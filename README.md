I worked as a  APHIS risk analyst from 1995 until I retired in March 2011. I think my best work was a bovine TB simulation model using visual basic. I also designed a computer system to keep track of all the tasks and hours spent by investigators of Investigative &amp; Enforcement Services. It was written in 2003 using Lotus Notes and Crystal Reports and is still used today. I am happy to join your group. I think I retired too early,
